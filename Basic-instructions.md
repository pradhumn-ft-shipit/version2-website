# FastTrackr AI Website, Agent Instructions

Pair programmer building the FastTrackr AI marketing site. Multi-page static site, hosted on Vercel.

**Audience:** B2B marketing site for an AI tool focused on **wealth-management advisor transitions** (transition consultants, breakaway advisors, RIAs, IBDs, custodians). Tone is enterprise-conservative, not consumer-bright.

**Every session:** Read `state/plan.md` first if it exists; update it when work is done. Append non-obvious decisions to `state/decisions.md`.

Copy and structure live in `/guideline-copy`. Read those files before building any page.

---

## Status

Pre-implementation. No `package.json`, no framework scaffolded yet, no build/lint/test commands. The first non-trivial task is to scaffold Astro + Tailwind (see `state/plan.md`). Until then, work is copy-organization, design-token extraction, and component planning.

```

## Stack

- **Framework:** Astro (preferred) or Next.js with static export. Astro is the cleaner fit, content-heavy, ships near-zero JS, easy component reuse across the ICP pages.
- **Hosting:** Vercel, Git deploy, preview URLs per branch
- **Forms:** Vercel serverless function → Resend email to the team. No CRM yet.
- **Styling:** Tailwind or vanilla CSS with semantic tokens. No CSS-in-JS.

---

## Design

Mobile-first methodology, not mobile-priority. Build base styles for 375px, layer up via media queries. Desktop is fully designed, just built on a mobile foundation. No horizontal scroll ever.

Design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, components) are defined in `guideline-copy/06-visuals.md`, that file is the source of truth. Don't invent tokens; if one is missing, add it there first, then mirror into `tailwind.config` / `tokens.css`.

**Invoke the `frontend-design` skill before building or restyling any UI.** (Installed globally; no project-local file needed.)

---

## Performance

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| LCP | < 2.5s on mobile |
| CLS | < 0.1 |
| TTI | < 3.5s |
| Page weight | < 500kb |

Lighthouse (mobile + desktop) before marking any page done. Static export wherever possible.

## Git identity

This repo lives at `github.com/pradhumn-ft-shipit/ft-new-website`. **Always commit and push from this repo as `pradhumn@fasttrackr.ai` (user `pradhumn-ft-shipit`).** Repo-local `.git/config` has `user.email`, `user.name`, and an authenticated `origin` URL set, so `git push` should just work without prompting. If a push prompts for credentials or fails with a 403 referring to a different account, the local config has been wiped, do not push from a different identity, fix the config first.

---

## Guardrails

- **Copy is sacred.** Pull from `/guideline-copy`. Don't rewrite, paraphrase, or invent.
- **No invented testimonials, stats, or logos.**
- **Every CTA goes to Book a Demo.** Single primary CTA per section. Self-serve sign-up can live behind a smaller link in the footer or pricing page if needed.
- **Always author SVGs** for icons, decorative shapes, flywheels, and animations, inline as Astro components, not raster `<img>`. Photographs only for testimonial avatars and product screenshots (per `06-visuals.md`).
- Secrets in Vercel env vars, never in code.
- More than 4 files touched → break into steps.
- Destructive actions → confirm first.
- New dependency → justify why native won't do, and log it in `state/decisions.md`.
